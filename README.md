# PSFC Shift Calendar Sync

Instead of searching the Park Slope Food Coop (PSFC) [📅 Shift Calendar](https://members.foodcoop.com/services/shifts/) to sign up for an available shift, you can now just search in your favorite calendar app. As featured on the [`@foodcoop` Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18038560394618051/) and the [Linewaiter's Gazette](https://linewaitersgazette.com/2025/05/13/may-13-2025-letters/)!

This works by scraping the PSFC Shift Calendar every 20 minutes, reconciling with a public calendar.
